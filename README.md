AI-Driven Resume Screening Project  


 The AI-Driven Resume Screening Project automates the resume evaluation process using Machine Learning (ML) and Power BI.

ðŸ”¹ Why this project?
Traditional resume screening is time-consuming and often biased. This AI-powered solution improves efficiency by:
A) Automatically analyzing resumes to match job descriptions
B) Ranking candidates based on Match Score
C) Providing insights into job fit using Power BI visualizations
D) Reducing manual effort and increasing fairness in hiring

 How it works:
Resume Parsing: Extracts candidate details like skills, experience, and education.
Match Score Calculation: Compares candidate skills with job requirements.
Power BI Dashboard: Visualizes insights such as top-matching candidates, job fit analysis, and skill gaps.
AI-Driven Filters: Allows recruiters to filter resumes based on experience, skills, and match score.

This project provides a data-driven hiring approach, improving decision-making and reducing recruitment time.
